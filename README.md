# DubiousEngine
Welcome to the Dubious Engine. This is my attempt to create an *understandable* Physics Engine. 
It's a Discrete Engine that uses GJK and EPA to perform collision detection and response.

My initial goal was to bring this Engine to the point where it could stably stack a large number
of cubes as fast as possible. I think I have acheived this as it will currently stack 120 cubes
at 40 fps on my mid level desktop PC.

In an attempt to provide meaningful documentation about it, I am creating posts here:

Questions, comments, suggestions, etc are always welcome. The blog listed above would be the
best place to start the discussion.
